Mneme is a robust event-sourcing library for Rust projects. Named after the
Greek muse of memory, Mneme helps you maintain a complete and accurate history
of your domain events. It is built on top of [Kurrent](https://kurrent.dev/)
(formerly EventStoreDB) and provides a clean, type-safe API for implementing
event-sourced systems.
